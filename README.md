This fork from gpuocelot aims to provide the emulator for newer version of Cuda & PTX ISA.
 The original project at [https://github.com/gtcasl/gpuocelot](https://github.com/gtcasl/gpuocelot) is no longer actively maintained.

Current status : 

* No longer matained
* Works & tested on GCC 4.7.3 & CUDA 4.2


My plan:

* Support lastest version of CUDA & GCC 
* Extend the PTX instruction set for research purpose
